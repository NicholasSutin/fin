    <h1>Investing</h1>
    <p>The first thing you should ask yourself before investing is if you're saving for retirement, if you're saving for something like college, or simply accumulating wealth without a specific framework in mind.</p>

    <p>Typically, Any account that's non-taxable has a contribution limit. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-taxable (or tax-advantaged) accounts — like Roth IRAs, Traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, HSAs — usually have contribution limits set by the IRS.</li>
        <li>Taxable accounts — like a regular brokerage account (or custodial) — do not have contribution limits. You can put in as much money as you want.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Traditional IRA</b></p>

        <li>Lower contribution limits than 401(k)s but still valuable for those looking to save outside of a workplace plan.</li>
        <li>Contribution limit (2025): $6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50+ (catch-up).</li>

      <h2>Taxable Brokerage</h2>
      <p>A taxable Brokerage account is much more flexible, and can be opened with many firms. Unlike retirement accounts, there ar eno contribution limits, and no withdrawal restrictions. <br> However, you must pay <b>capital gains taxes</b> on profits and <b>income taxes</b> on dividents or interest earned. Its a great option for building wealth beyond retirement or saving for something like buying a house, starting a business, or early retirement.</p>
      <p>If you're an active investor, consider looking in to margin accounts compared to cash accounts. To open a margin account within a taxable brokerage account, the minimum equity requirement is $2,000 in cash or marginable securities. This is mandated by FINRA and applies across all U.S. brokerages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Margin:</strong> Deposit at least 50% of the purchase price of securities. <em>– FINRA</em></li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance Margin:</strong> Maintain at least 25% equity; brokers may require more. <em>– FINRA</em></li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Day Trader:</strong> Maintain $25,000 equity if engaging in frequent day trading. <em>– U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</em></li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cash account</strong> = Pay fully up front.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin account</strong> = Borrow to invest more, but it’s <strong>riskier</strong> and you’ll <strong>pay interest</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that if using a cash account, there is something called CB (cost basis). If you bought a share at $60, and sold for a loss at $40, and then bought that same security within the short-term, your original transaction would no longer be considered a "loss", and instead, your newest purchase would have that additional $20 difference applied to it. So now if you buy that same stock at $35, it will cost you $55. But don't be mistaken, this doesn't actually cost you anything extra, and is simply used as an anti tax fraud measure.</p>
      <p>With cash accounts, you need to wait for funds to be settled and ready to trade with. the time it takes for these funds to settle from the market back into your account typically takes <b>T + 2 days</b> (Trade Date + 2 business days) to officially settle.</p>
      <p>If you use those "unsettled" proceeds to buy another stock and then sell that new stock before the original funds settle, you trigger a <b>Good Faith Violation.</b> Your first or second violation will warrant a warning from your brokerage. However, 3+ violations within 12 months puts your account at risk of being restricted to "settled cash only" for 90 days (meaning you can only buy with fully settled funds), no instant re-trading.</p>

      <h2>Providers to use for brokerage accounts</h2>
      <p>There's often a lot of fluff surrounding which broker to use for just a simple taxable brokerage account. There can be hidden fees such as account minimums, inactive account fees, trade commissions, options fees, Foreign Transaction fees (for international stocks or ETFs, or forex), and margin fees (on borrowed funds with interest rates), wire transfer fees, paper statement fees, short selling fees, and transfer fees.</p>
      <p>To minimize these costs, look for no-fee brokers (like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Robinhood) that offer commission-free trading for your use case.</p>
      <p>The most popular brokers include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.schwab.com/pricing">Schwab:</a></b> Very good ThinkOrSwim platform with in-depth market data (and education) without any fee, commission-free stocks and ETFs, $0 options + $0.65 per contract fee, $0 mutual funds, $0 Bonds, $2.25/futures contract.

        <li>SoFi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="custodial-accounts">Custodial accounts</h2>
    <p>There are a couple of main types of custodial accounts, typically used for managing assets for minors until they reach adulthood. Here are the most common types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) Accounts</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To hold and manage assets for a minor until they reach the age of majority (usually 18 or 21, depending on state law).</li>
      <li><strong>Types of Assets:</strong> Typically includes <strong>cash</strong>, <strong>stocks</strong>, <strong>bonds</strong>, and <strong>mutual funds</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> The custodian manages the assets until the minor comes of age, at which point the minor takes full control.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> The income generated from the investments is taxed at the minor's tax rate, which could be beneficial if the child is in a lower tax bracket.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) Accounts</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Similar to the UGMA, but it allows for a broader range of assets, including <strong>real estate</strong>, <strong>artwork</strong>, and other types of property.</li>
      <li><strong>Types of Assets:</strong> Cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate (depending on state law).</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> Like the UGMA, the custodian manages the assets until the minor reaches the age of majority, after which control is transferred to the minor.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Like UGMA, the minor is taxed on any income generated by the assets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Custodial Brokerage Accounts</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To invest in the stock market, mutual funds, ETFs, and other securities on behalf of a minor.</li>
      <li><strong>Types of Assets:</strong> Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> The custodian manages the account until the minor reaches the age of majority.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Investment income is subject to taxes, and for higher-income minors, the "kiddie tax" could apply, meaning some of the income might be taxed at the parents' tax rate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Custodial Roth IRA</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To allow a minor to contribute to a Roth IRA, potentially building a tax-free retirement fund early on.</li>
      <li><strong>Types of Assets:</strong> Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> The custodian manages the account, but the minor must have <strong>earned income</strong> to contribute to the Roth IRA (e.g., from a job or self-employment).</li>
      <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Contributions are made with after-tax money, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UGMA vs. UTMA:</strong> The main difference is that UTMA accounts allow a broader range of assets, including real estate, while UGMA is limited to financial assets like stocks and bonds.</li>
  <li><strong>Custodial Roth IRA:</strong> This allows for tax-advantaged retirement savings and is beneficial if the minor has earned income.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to Use a Custodial Account:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Savings for Education:</strong> Some parents use custodial accounts to save for a child’s education, though 529 plans are often preferred for educational savings due to their tax advantages.</li>
  <li><strong>Investing for the Future:</strong> These accounts can be used to teach children about investing and to give them a head start on building wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fidelity youth is another account for minors that exists, but isn't one of the officially named "custodial" accounts. The teen is the sole owner and decision-maker of the account, not a joint or custodial account. Most US stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds are tradable, and debit cards can be requested. Educational tools are also provided.</p>
