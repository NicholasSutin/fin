    <h1>FAFSA</h1>
    <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a form that U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens complete to apply for financial aid to pay for college or graduate school.</p>
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To complete the FAFSA, you need to be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen (e.g., a permanent resident).</li>
        <p>If you are a male between the ages of 18 and 25, you must be registered with the Selective Service (the U.S. draft system) to be eligible for federal student aid. If you have not registered, you may still be able to register or explain why you're exempt when completing the FAFSA.</p>
        <li>You must have a valid Social Security number (SSN) or an Alien Registration Number.</li>
        <li>You need to be enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an eligible institution.</li>
        <li>You must demonstrate financial need (depending on the program).</li>
        <li>Drug convictions: If you have been convicted of a drug-related crime while receiving federal student aid, you may be ineligible for some types of aid. Your eligibility may be restored after a period or if you complete a drug rehabilitation program. A felony conviction, especially related to drug possession or distribution, can affect your eligibility for federal financial aid, but each case is reviewed individually.</li>
        <li>For some programs, you may need to maintain satisfactory academic progress.</li>
        <li>Degree Type: You must be pursuing an eligible undergraduate, graduate, or professional degree. Certain non-degree programs (like certain certificate programs) may not qualify for aid. You must be enrolled in at least half-time (usually at least 6 credit hours for undergraduate students) to receive federal student loans and work-study. Graduate students must also be enrolled at least half-time to be eligible for federal financial aid.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Getting Prepared</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dependent Student: If you’re considered a dependent student, you will need to include your parents’ financial information on your FAFSA. You’re generally considered a dependent student if you're under 24, unmarried, and don't have dependents of your own.</li>
        <li>Independent Studnet: If you’re considered an independent student, you only need to include your own financial information (and your spouse’s if applicable).
            You’re typically considered independent if you’re 24 or older, married, a graduate or professional student, a veteran, an orphan, or otherwise meet specific criteria.
            </li>
        <li>The FAFSA opens each year on October 1st for the next academic year.</li>
        <li>Deadlines vary, so it's important to check the federal and state deadlines.</li>
        <li>Some states and schools offer funds on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's best to apply as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Have access to a SSN, date of birth, and email.</li>
        <li>Provide Financial Information: Your (and your parents' if you're a dependent) tax returns, W-2 forms, and records of untaxed income.</li>
        <li>School Information: List of schools you're applying to or planning to attend.</li>
        <li>FSA ID: You'll need a Federal Student Aid ID to sign your FAFSA electronically. You can <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch">create one on the FAFSA website</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Types of Financial Aid Available:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grants: Typically need-based, such as the Pell Grant.</li>
        <li>Loans: Federal student loans with lower interest rates, such as Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans.</li>
        <li>Work-Study: Part-time jobs funded by the federal government for students with financial need.</li>
        <li>Scholarships: Some scholarships are awarded based on FAFSA information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>FAFSA Results: Student Aid Report (SAR)</h2>
    <p>After you submit your FAFSA, you'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR), which summarizes the information you provided. It will include your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), a number used to determine your eligibility for financial aid. The SAR may require corrections, especially if there are discrepancies or missing information.</p>
    <p><b>Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</b></p>
    <p>The EFC is used to calculate the amount of financial aid you are eligible for. The lower the EFC, the more likely you are to qualify for need-based aid.</p>

    <h2>How Schools Determine Aid</h2>
    <p>Each school you list on your FAFSA will use the information to create a financial aid package for you, which may include federal, state, and institutional aid. Your cost of attendance (tuition, fees, room and board, etc.) is used alongside your EFC to determine your financial need.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You need to fill out a FAFSA every year you're in school to continue receiving federal financial aid. By completing the FAFSA, you're opening the door to various types of financial assistance, so it's a critical step in funding your education.</p>
