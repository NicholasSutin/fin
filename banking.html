      <h2>Interest Rates:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Deposit Interest Rates:</b> The percentage of money banks pay you for keeping your money in certain types of accounts (e.g., savings, CDs).</li>
        <li><b>Loan Interest Rates: </b>The rate charged for borrowing money, affecting how much you pay back on loans like mortgages, car loans, or credit cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Credit and Loans:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Credit Scores</strong>: Your credit score influences the interest rates on loans and credit cards. A good score typically results in lower rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Mortgages</strong>: understand the terms of home loans, down payments, interest rates, and the impact on monthly payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Loans and Lines of Credit</strong>: Learn how these work and how interest is charged.</li>
        <li><strong>Student Loans</strong>: If applicable, understanding how student loans work, repayment plans, and interest rates.</li>
        <li>Set up automatic bull payments to avoid missed due dates. Using direct deposit for regular income to streamline receiving payment can be a useful tool.</li>
        <li><b>Auto Loans:</b>Loans to buy a car, where the car acts as collateral. If you don’t pay, the lender can repossess the car.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How Interest Rates Work:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interest</strong>: Interest is the cost you pay for borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed Interest Rate</strong>: The rate stays the same throughout the loan term (e.g., for mortgages or personal loans). This means your monthly payments are predictable.</li>
        <li><strong>Variable (or Adjustable) Interest Rate</strong>: The rate can change over time, usually tied to an index or benchmark rate (e.g., the Federal Reserve’s rate). This can lead to higher or lower payments during the life of the loan.</li>
        <li><strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</strong>: This includes not only the interest rate but also any fees associated with the loan, giving you a clearer picture of the true cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Interest Rate</strong>: Borrowers with lower credit scores (riskier to lend to) typically face higher interest rates to compensate lenders for the risk.</li>
        <li><strong>How Interest Is Calculated</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Interest</strong>: Calculated on the initial loan amount throughout the loan term.</li>
            <li><strong>Compound Interest</strong>: Calculated on the loan amount and any previously accrued interest, meaning you could pay interest on top of interest.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
