    <h1>Taxes</h1>


    <h2>Understanding Federal Taxes</h2>
    <p>Federal taxes fund national programs like defense, Social Security, and healthcare. Most U.S. citizens must pay income tax on earnings, as well as payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Progressive System:</b> Higher income falls into higher tax brackets (10% up to 37%).</li>
      <li><b>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):</b> Your total income minus certain adjustments (e.g., student loan interest).</li>
      <li><b>Taxable Income:</b> AGI minus deductions (standard or itemized).</li>
      <li><b>Payroll Taxes:</b> 6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare withheld from pay; employer matches these amounts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Who Needs to File</h2>
    <p>Most citizens or residents with income above certain thresholds must file a federal return each year by April 15.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you earn wages and receive a <b>Form W-2</b>, you generally file.</li>
      <li>Self-employed or gig workers receiving <b>Form 1099-NEC</b> must file if net earnings ≥ $400.</li>
      <li>Dependents, retirees, and students may also need to file, even on small incomes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Deductions &amp; Credits</h2>
    <p>Deductions lower taxable income; credits reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Standard Deduction:</b> $13,850 single; $27,700 married filing jointly (2024).</li>
      <li><b>Itemized Deductions:</b> Mortgage interest, state taxes paid, charitable gifts, medical expenses (above 7.5% of AGI).</li>
      <li><b>Popular Credits:</b> Child Tax Credit ($2,000/child), Earned Income Tax Credit (varies), education credits.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Connecticut State Taxes</h2>
    <p>Connecticut levies its own income tax, sales tax, and property tax, which fund state services like education and transportation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Income Tax:</b> Rates range from 3% to 6.99% across six brackets.</li>
      <li><b>Sales Tax:</b> 6.35% on most goods; essential items like groceries are exempt.</li>
      <li><b>Property Tax:</b> Levied by municipalities; rate varies by town.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Filing in Connecticut</h2>
    <p>File your state return by April 15 (same as federal). You’ll use Form CT-1040 or CT-1040NR/PY if nonresident or part-year resident.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with your federal AGI; add or subtract any state-specific adjustments.</li>
      <li>Claim the Connecticut personal exemption ($15,000 per filer) and any credits (e.g., Property Tax Credit).</li>
      <li>Pay online via the Department of Revenue Services (DRS) website or mail a paper check.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Key Dates &amp; Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>April 15:</b> Federal and Connecticut filing deadline.</li>
      <li><b>October 15:</b> Extended filing deadline if you filed Form 4868 by April 15.</li>
      <li><b>Quarterly Estimated Taxes:</b> April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 (for self-employed).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Helpful Tips for Financial Literacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Track Income Early:</b> Save W-2s and 1099s as you receive them.</li>
      <li><b>Use Withholding Tools:</b> Adjust your Form W-4 to avoid large balances due or big refunds.</li>
      <li><b>Plan for Credits:</b> Identify education, energy, or child-related credits ahead of time.</li>
      <li><b>Keep Records:</b> Maintain receipts and statements for 3–7 years in case of audit.</li>
      <li><b>Consult a Professional:</b> If your situation is complex (stocks, rental property, small business), consider a CPA.</li>
    </ul>
