    <h2>Where should I start if I'm new to investing?</h2>
    <p>It's typically very difficult to outperform the market as an individual investor. Even institutional-level analysts rarely every outperform the S&P 500. However, if you are willing to spend a time committment, or have clear conviction on what companies you want to invest in, picking your own investments can provide an edge. In Markets like the current one, where volatility is high and the year-to-date market return is negative, individual stock picking can actually be quite beneficial.</p>
    <p>To research a stock, look at its EPS and trailing vs forward P/E ratio. Look at their financial reports and sentiment, as well as earnings outlooks.</p>
    <p>Peter Lynch, one of the greatest growth investors of all time, once said, "If you're in the right stock, it's better to hold on for the long term." The top 5 ground rules he uses before investing are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PE &lt; 20</li>
        <li>Forward PE &lt; 15</li>
        <li>EPS Growth &gt; 15%</li>
        <li>Profit margin &gt; 15%</li>
        <li>ROIC &gt; 15%</li>
        <li>Debt / FCF &lt; 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may find it useful to set up a screener with these criteria.</p>
    <p>Consider volume before placing a trade; how liquid is this security? Also take analyst ratings with a grain of salt. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1042443117302196">Studies</a> have shown that ratings are positively overexaggerated by a 5:1 ratio.</p>
    <p>When considering active trading, take into account a few guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trade to trade well, not to make money</li>
        <li>Fiercely protect capital</li>
        <li>Act immediately without hestitation on qualified setups</li>
        <li>The only thing worse than being wrong is staying wrong</li>
        <li>Don't "revenge trade," where you try to make money back that you lost. Take a break for a day or few.</li>
        <li>Wait for a good setup instead of taking a mediocre one</li>
        <li>Paper trade, backtest, and educate yourself before going all-in on a live account.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If you lack the time or resources to do individual research</h2>
    <p>Often, simply putting money into the SPX, SPY, and QQQ will outperform many established funds. just look at how many years passed before <u>BRK.B</u> outperformed the market on an annual percentage scale. </p>
    <p>Asset managers are an available solution. Firms like Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, and Interactive Brokers all provide a form of passive investing. It is also worth looking into third parties like <u>Bravos Research</u>, or your own personal advisor.</p>
    <p>Beware of scams where people will tell you to copy their trades, and always ensure you are communicating with a licensed financial advisor whose personal identity and contact you know.</p>
    <p>Putting money into things like gold, silver, and SPDR select sector funds, as well as mutual funds and bonds are how many individuals approach the market today.</p>
    <p>It's never too early or too late to invest in the market, you simply need to find a sector that aligns with your reward-risk ratio and own criteria, so start now.</p>
